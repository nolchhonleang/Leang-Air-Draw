Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
A webcam for hand tracking
Dependencies:
opencv-python
numpy
mediapipe
pillow



Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/nolchhonleang/Leang-Air-Draw.git
cd Leang-Air-Draw


Install dependencies:pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe pillow


Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.

Usage

python leang_air_draw.py


The interface consists of:

Left Panel: Displays the camera feed and your drawings.
Right Panel: Settings for modes, brush, and colors.

Pinch Mode: Pinch your thumb and index finger to draw.
Pointer Mode: Extend your index finger while keeping other fingers down.
Adjust brush size (5-60px) and opacity (0.1-1.0) in the "Brush" section.
Select a color from the palette or click "Pick Color" in the "Colors" section.


Moving:

Notes

Ensure good lighting and a clear camera view for accurate hand tracking.
The application supports up to four hands, each assigned a different color.
Saved images combine the camera feed and drawings with 0.6/0.4 transparency.
The UI features a dark, neon theme for a modern look.
